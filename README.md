# Coursera_Capstone

As part of the IBM Data Science course ([Professional Certificate on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/professional-cert/BRBQRXNEX5UP)), I was required to do a project involving clustering of geospatial data and communicate my findings. I have chosen to perform an exploratory analysis of Chicago neighborhoods, and compare them based on several crucial parameters. This is result of my work. The summary can also be found in [my post on Medium](https://rybakrot.medium.com/exploring-chicago-neighborhoods-b61b655ba90d).
